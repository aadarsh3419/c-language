/*
we use variable  =A reusable container foa a value.
                behave as if it were the value it contains.
And to print the result we use printf
And to store a variable we use % sign we use character after that for differnt varibales to 
different character like
int = %d ( it use 4bytes in modern systems)
float = %f ( it use 4bytes)
double = %.15lf ( it use 8 bytes)
char = %c ( it use 1 bytes)
char[] = %c  array of characters( size varies)
bool = %d ( 1 bytes , requires <stdbool.h>)
